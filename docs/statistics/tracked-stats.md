## Data Dimensions

All stats (except reference files) support two filter dimensions:

| Dimension | Values | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Time Period | `all`, `6m`, `3m`, `1m` | Months before current date |
| Map | `all`, `Dunes`, `Snowmelt`, `Tropics` | All Maps aggregates across all maps |

Data is nested as `data[period][map]`. Smaller slices (e.g., 1M + Tropics) will have very few games and unreliable stats.

## Reference Data (No Filters)

| File | Contents | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `cards.json` | Full card catalog (name, faction, type, subtype, cost, art path) | Flat array, not period/map nested |
| `commanders.json` | Commander list (name, faction, art path) | Flat array |
